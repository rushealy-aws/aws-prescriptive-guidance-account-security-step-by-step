## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [ ] An AWS account (if you don't have one, [create one here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/))
- [ ] Access to the AWS Management Console
- [ ] Administrative privileges in your AWS account
- [ ] A mobile device or authenticator app for MFA setup

### Recommended Order

While you can implement these controls in any order, we recommend following this sequence for the best experience:

1. **Start with the basics** (ACCT.01, ACCT.02, ACCT.05) - Set up contacts, secure root access, and enable MFA
2. **Configure user access** (ACCT.03, ACCT.04, ACCT.06) - Create proper user management
3. **Enable monitoring** (ACCT.07, ACCT.10, ACCT.11, ACCT.12) - Set up logging and alerting
4. **Clean up and secure** (ACCT.08, ACCT.09) - Remove unnecessary resources and secure S3

## üí° Tips for Success

- **Take your time**: Security is important - don't rush through the steps
- **Test as you go**: Verify each control is working before moving to the next
- **Keep records**: Document what you've implemented and any customizations you've made
- **Stay updated**: AWS security best practices evolve, so revisit this guide periodically

## üÜò Need Help?

- **AWS Documentation**: Each control page includes links to official AWS documentation
- **AWS Support**: If you have a support plan, don't hesitate to reach out
