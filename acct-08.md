# ACCT.08 - Prevent Public Access to Private S3 Buckets

## üéØ What This Control Does

This control prevents accidental public exposure of your S3 buckets by enabling Block Public Access settings. This acts as a safety net to prevent data breaches caused by misconfigured bucket policies or ACLs.

## üîç Why This Matters

- **Data breach prevention**: Stops accidental exposure of sensitive data
- **Compliance requirement**: Many regulations require protection of private data
- **Cost protection**: Prevents unexpected charges from public data access
- **Reputation protection**: Avoids embarrassing public data exposures
- **Defense in depth**: Additional layer even if bucket policies are misconfigured

## üõ°Ô∏è Understanding S3 Public Access

### How Buckets Become Public
S3 buckets can become publicly accessible through:
- **Bucket policies** that grant public permissions
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** that allow public access
- **Cross-account access** that's too permissive
- **Misconfigured IAM policies**

### Block Public Access Settings
AWS provides four settings to prevent public access:

1. **BlockPublicAcls**: Blocks new public ACLs
2. **IgnorePublicAcls**: Ignores existing public ACLs
3. **BlockPublicPolicy**: Blocks new public bucket policies
4. **RestrictPublicBuckets**: Restricts access to buckets with public policies

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Enable Account-Level Block Public Access

This is the most important step - it protects all buckets in your account:

1. **Navigate to S3 Console**:
   - Go to [S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3)
   - Look for **Block Public Access settings for this account** on the left sidebar

2. **Configure Account Settings**:
   - Click **Edit** next to "Block Public Access settings for this account"
   - **Enable all four settings**:
     ```
     ‚úÖ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)
     ‚úÖ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)
     ‚úÖ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies
     ‚úÖ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any public bucket or access point policies
     ```

3. **Confirm Changes**:
   - Type `confirm` in the confirmation box
   - Click **Confirm**

### Step 2: Review Existing Buckets

1. **List All Buckets**:
   - In S3 console, review the main bucket list
   - Look for any buckets marked as "Public" in the Access column

2. **Check Each Bucket**:
   - Click on each bucket name
   - Go to the **Permissions** tab
   - Review the **Block public access** settings

### Step 3: Configure Individual Bucket Settings

For each bucket that needs individual attention:

1. **Access Bucket Permissions**:
   - Click on the bucket name
   - Go to **Permissions** tab
   - Find **Block public access (bucket settings)**

2. **Enable Block Public Access**:
   - Click **Edit**
   - Enable all four settings (same as account level):
     ```
     ‚úÖ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)
     ‚úÖ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)
     ‚úÖ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies
     ‚úÖ Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any public bucket or access point policies
     ```
   - Click **Save changes**
   - Type `confirm` and click **Confirm**

### Step 4: Handle Legitimate Public Buckets

If you have buckets that legitimately need to be public (like static websites):

1. **Document the need**: Clearly document why the bucket must be public
2. **Use specific permissions**: Grant only the minimum necessary public access
3. **Regular review**: Review public buckets monthly
4. **Consider alternatives**: Use CloudFront distributions instead of direct S3 public access

#### Example: Static Website Bucket
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-website-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### Check Account-Level Settings
1. **Verify account settings**:
   - Go to S3 console main page
   - Confirm "Block Public Access is on for this account" appears
   - All four settings should show as enabled

### Test Public Access Prevention
1. **Create a test bucket**:
   - Create a new S3 bucket
   - Try to make it public through bucket policy
   - Verify the action is blocked

2. **Test existing buckets**:
   - Try to add public ACLs to existing buckets
   - Verify these actions are blocked
   - Check that legitimate private access still works

### Review with Trusted Advisor
1. **Check Trusted Advisor**:
   - Go to [Trusted Advisor console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/trustedadvisor)
   - Look for S3 bucket permissions checks
   - Verify no buckets are flagged as publicly accessible

## üí° Best Practices

### Account Management
- **Enable at account level**: Always start with account-level settings
- **Default deny**: Make "block public access" the default for new buckets
- **Regular audits**: Review public access settings monthly
- **Automation**: Use AWS Config rules to monitor compliance

### Bucket-Specific Settings
- **Individual review**: Check each bucket's specific needs
- **Least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Documentation**: Document any exceptions and their justification
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for changes to public access settings

### Alternative Solutions
- **CloudFront**: Use CloudFront for public content distribution
- **Presigned URLs**: Use presigned URLs for temporary public access
- **API Gateway**: Use API Gateway for controlled public access
- **Application Load Balancer**: Use ALB for web application public access

## üö® Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ‚ùå Only setting bucket-level controls without account-level protection
- ‚ùå Disabling controls for convenience without proper justification
- ‚ùå Not documenting legitimate public bucket requirements
- ‚ùå Forgetting to test legitimate access after enabling controls
- ‚ùå Not monitoring for changes to public access settings
- ‚ùå Using public buckets when CloudFront would be more appropriate
- ‚ùå Not having a process for reviewing public bucket needs

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Using AWS CLI
```bash
# Enable account-level block public access
aws s3control put-public-access-block \
    --account-id 123456789012 \
    --public-access-block-configuration \
    BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true

# Enable for specific bucket
aws s3api put-public-access-block \
    --bucket my-bucket-name \
    --public-access-block-configuration \
    BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true

# Check current settings
aws s3api get-public-access-block --bucket my-bucket-name
```

### AWS Config Rules
Set up AWS Config to monitor compliance:

```json
{
    "ConfigRuleName": "s3-bucket-public-access-prohibited",
    "Source": {
        "Owner": "AWS",
        "SourceIdentifier": "S3_BUCKET_PUBLIC_ACCESS_PROHIBITED"
    }
}
```

### CloudFormation Template
```yaml
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: !Sub "${AWS::StackName}-private-bucket"
      PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
        BlockPublicAcls: true
        BlockPublicPolicy: true
        IgnorePublicAcls: true
        RestrictPublicBuckets: true
```

## üìä Monitoring and Alerting

### CloudWatch Metrics
Monitor these metrics:
- `NumberOfObjects` - Track object count changes
- `BucketSizeBytes` - Monitor storage usage
- `AllRequests` - Track access patterns

### CloudTrail Events to Monitor
- `PutBucketAcl`
- `PutBucketPolicy` 
- `PutPublicAccessBlock`
- `DeletePublicAccessBlock`

### Sample CloudWatch Alarm
```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
    --alarm-name "S3-Public-Access-Block-Disabled" \
    --alarm-description "Alert when S3 public access block is disabled" \
    --metric-name "PublicAccessBlockDisabled" \
    --namespace "AWS/S3" \
    --statistic "Sum" \
    --period 300 \
    --threshold 1 \
    --comparison-operator "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
```
